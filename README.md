# PostgreSQL for Everybody - University of Michigan
This repository represents the complete execution journey and portfolio of **Fahad Shah ([1FahadShah](https://github.com/1FahadShah))** through the entire **[PostgreSQL for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/postgresql-for-everybody)** offered by the **University of Michigan** on Coursera.

It contains a meticulously documented collection of hands-on Jupyter notebooks that cover a wide spectrum of database engineering. The curriculum progresses from foundational SQL and relational data modeling, through advanced application integration with Python, to high-level system architecture, scalability patterns, and the integration of NoSQL technologies like Elasticsearch.
