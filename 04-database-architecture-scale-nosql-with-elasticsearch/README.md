# Course 4: Database Architecture, Scale, and NoSQL with Elasticsearch
[![Coursera Certificate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coursera-Certificate-blue?logo=coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/YOUR-CERTIFICATE-ID-HERE)

This repository contains hands-on Jupyter notebooks built and documented by **Fahad Shah (1FahadShah)**. It represents my personal learning journey and practical solutions for **[Course 4: Database Architecture, Scale, and NoSQL with Elasticsearch](https://www.coursera.org/learn/database-architecture-scale-nosql)** from the **PostgreSQL for Everybody Specialization** offered by the **University of Michigan** on Coursera.

This course moves beyond a single database to cover high-level architectural patterns for building scalable, resilient, and high-performance systems. It explores fundamental scaling strategies, cloud-native application design, and the integration of specialized NoSQL systems like Elasticsearch.

## ðŸ“š Course Structure

This course consists of **three main modules**, each documented with conceptual notebooks that explain modern system design principles.

## ðŸ““ Notebook Overviews

### 1. Scaling Databases
**Highlights:**
* **Scale Up vs. Scale Out**: Understanding the fundamental trade-offs between making one server more powerful (vertical) and adding more servers (horizontal).
* **Replication for Reads**: Using a Primary-Replica architecture to handle high-volume read traffic.
* **Sharding for Writes**: Exploring the complex but powerful technique of sharding to scale write-heavy workloads.
* **Caching is King**: Implementing caching strategies as the most effective first step to reduce database load.

### 2. Cloud Scale Applications
**Highlights:**
* **Stateless Architecture**: Learning why statelessness is the absolute prerequisite for effective horizontal scaling and high availability.
* **Microservices**: Contrasting the monolith and microservice patterns to build agile and resilient systems.
* **Decoupling Components**: Using Message Queues for asynchronous communication and Object Storage for large files to build robust applications.
* **Global Performance**: Leveraging Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and a multi-layered caching strategy to reduce latency for users worldwide.
* **Polyglot Persistence**: Embracing the modern "right tool for the right job" approach by using multiple, specialized data stores in a single application.

### 3. Elasticsearch
**Highlights:**
* **Search Engine Fundamentals**: An introduction to Elasticsearch as a dedicated, document-oriented search engine and its core concepts.
* **REST API and Query DSL**: Interacting with Elasticsearch via its API and building complex, fine-tuned search queries with its powerful JSON-based Query DSL.
* **Application Integration**: Using the official Python client to programmatically index data and perform searches.
* **Hybrid Architecture**: Designing a robust "Search-as-a-Sidecar" pattern, using PostgreSQL as the source of truth and Elasticsearch as the powerful, secondary search index.
