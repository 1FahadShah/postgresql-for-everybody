    "Throughout this specialization, we've seen that different data storage problems have different optimal solutions. Let's review the strengths of the technologies we've discussed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PostgreSQL (Relational)**: The best choice for core transactional data that requires strong consistency and integrity (ACID compliance). Perfect for user accounts, financial transactions, and orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NoSQL (Document/Key-Value)**: Best for flexible, schemaless data that needs to operate at a massive scale, often prioritizing availability over strict consistency. Examples: user profiles, product catalogs, IoT data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object Storage (S3)**: The only correct choice for storing large binary files (images, videos, backups). It's cheap, durable, and infinitely scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In-Memory Store (Redis)**: The best choice for caching, session management, and any data that requires microsecond latency."

A skilled carpenter has a full toolbox and knows when to use each tool: a hammer for nails, a screwdriver for screws, a saw for cutting wood, and a level for making sure things are straight. Polyglot persistence is about having a full data toolbox and knowing when to use each database technology."

    "4.  The application servers handle different tasks by talking to different data stores:\n",
    "    - A user's login attempt reads from the **PostgreSQL Primary** database to ensure the most up-to-date user information.\n",
    "    - A request to browse the product catalog is served from a fast **Redis Cache**. If it's a cache miss, the data is read from a **PostgreSQL Read Replica**.\n",
    "    - When a user places an order, the application writes the order to the **PostgreSQL Primary** and sends a message to a **Message Queue**.\n",
    "    - A separate, asynchronous \"Order Processing\" microservice consumes messages from the queue to handle shipping, billing, etc., and updates the **PostgreSQL Primary**.\n",
    "    - All product images are stored in and served from **S3**.\n",
    "    - A user's search query is routed to a specialized **Elasticsearch** cluster for fast, relevant text search (foreshadowing our next module)."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"SQL vs. NoSQL\" debate is over. The modern solution is to use a hybrid, or **polyglot**, approach. The key skill for a modern architect or developer is not knowing one database perfectly, but understanding the strengths and weaknesses of many different data stores and knowing how to combine them to build a resilient, scalable, and performant system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Powerful, multi-model databases like **PostgreSQL** are often the centerpiece of this architecture, providing the reliability of ACID transactions for core data while seamlessly integrating with other specialized NoSQL data stores."
