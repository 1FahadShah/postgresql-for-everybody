# Scaling Databases

This repository contains hands-on Jupyter notebooks built and documented by **Fahad Shah (1FahadShah)**. They represent my execution and learning journey through the **"PostgreSQL for Everybody" Specialization** offered by the **University of Michigan** on **Coursera**.

This Module covers the fundamental strategies and architectural patterns for scaling a database to handle increasing amounts of data and concurrent users. The notebooks transition from foundational concepts to advanced, real-world techniques used in large-scale applications.

## Notebooks Overview üìì

### `01-scaling-up-vs-scaling-out.ipynb`
- Provides a detailed conceptual comparison of the two primary scaling methods.
- **Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)**: Making a single server more powerful (more CPU, RAM, faster disks).
- **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)**: Distributing the load across multiple servers.
- Explores the pros, cons, and cost implications of each approach using analogies and diagrams.

### `02-database-replication-for-read-scalability.ipynb`
- Dives into **database replication**, the most common technique for scaling read-heavy workloads.
- Explains the **Primary-Replica** architecture and how PostgreSQL's streaming replication works.
- Discusses the trade-offs between asynchronous and synchronous replication and the critical real-world challenge of **replication lag**.

### `03-sharding-for-write-scalability.ipynb`
- Tackles the complex challenge of scaling write operations through **sharding** (horizontal partitioning).
- Covers different **sharding strategies** (Range-Based, Hash-Based) and the importance of the shard key.
- Details the immense architectural difficulties sharding introduces, including cross-shard joins and distributed transactions.

### `04-caching-strategies-to-reduce-database-load.ipynb`
- Explores **caching** as the most effective first line of defense in scaling.
- Explains the widely-used **Cache-Aside** pattern for both read and write operations.
- Includes a practical **Python simulation** to demonstrate cache hits, misses, and invalidation in action.

## Key Takeaways ‚ú®

1.  **Scale Up First, Then Scale Out:** Vertical scaling is the simplest first step for growth. Horizontal scaling is more complex but essential for achieving high availability and massive scale.
2.  **Replicate for Reads:** Creating read-only replicas is the industry-standard solution for applications where data is read far more often than it is written.
3.  **Shard for Writes (With Caution):** Sharding is the ultimate solution for write-heavy workloads but should be a last resort due to its significant increase in architectural complexity.
4.  **Cache is King:** Caching is often the most impactful strategy, as it can eliminate the majority of read queries from ever reaching the database, dramatically improving performance and delaying the need for other scaling solutions.
5.  **Scaling is About Trade-offs:** Every scaling strategy involves a conscious trade-off between cost, complexity, performance, data consistency, and availability.

## Setup Instructions üõ†Ô∏è

1.  These notebooks are primarily conceptual and written in Markdown.
2.  The final notebook, `04-caching-strategies-to-reduce-database-load.ipynb`, contains a Python simulation and requires no external libraries.
3.  Run the Python cell in the final notebook to see the caching simulation in action.
