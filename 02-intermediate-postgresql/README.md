# Course 2: Intermediate PostgreSQL
[![Coursera Certificate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coursera-Certificate-blue?logo=coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/WXWIF14TTCCU)

This repository contains hands-on Jupyter notebooks built and documented by **Fahad Shah (1FahadShah)**. It represents my personal learning journey and practical solutions for **[Course 2: Intermediate PostgreSQL](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/WXWIF14TTCCU)** from the **PostgreSQL for Everybody Specialization**
offered by the **University of Michigan** on Coursera.

The notebooks build upon foundational knowledge to cover advanced SQL techniques, including schema evolution, complex queries, transaction management, text processing, and performance optimizationâ€”skills essential for building robust, real-world applications.

## ðŸ“š Course Structure

This course consists of **four main modules**, each documented with dedicated notebooks that transition from theory to practical application.

## ðŸ““ Notebook Overviews

### 1. SQL Techniques
**Notebooks:**
* `01-alter-table-schema.ipynb`
* `02-dates.ipynb`
* `03-distinct-group-by.ipynb`
* `04-subqueries.ipynb`
* `05-concurrency-and-transactions.ipynb`
* `06-stored-procedures.ipynb`

**Highlights:**
* **Schema Evolution**: Using `ALTER TABLE` to add, modify, and drop columns and constraints.
* **Temporal Data**: Handling `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`, and `INTERVAL` with functions like `EXTRACT()` and `AGE()`.
* **Data Aggregation**: Grouping with `GROUP BY`, filtering groups with `HAVING`, and using aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`).
* **Advanced Queries**: Writing nested and scalar subqueries with `IN`, `EXISTS`, and `FROM` clauses.
* **Data Integrity**: Managing transactions with `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and understanding concurrency.
* **Encapsulation**: Creating and managing **stored procedures** to reuse SQL logic.

### 2. Business Applications with SQL
**Notebooks:**
* `01-simple-business.ipynb`
* `02-advanced-queries-and-subqueries.ipynb`
* `03-transactions-concurrency-and-procedures.ipynb`

**Highlights:**
* **Practical Data Modeling**: Designing a complete e-commerce schema (`customers`, `products`, `orders`).
* **Business Intelligence Queries**: Applying correlated subqueries and advanced aggregation (`STRING_AGG`) to derive business insights.
* **Enterprise Features**: Using **transactions**, row-level locking (`SELECT FOR UPDATE`), and **triggers** in a practical business context to ensure data integrity and automate logic.

### 3. Advanced Text Handling & Hashing
**Notebooks:**
* `01-text-in-databases.ipynb`
* `02-text-functions.ipynb`
* `03-character-sets.ipynb`
* `04-inside-hashes.ipynb`
* `05-index-choices-and-techniques.ipynb`

**Highlights:**
* **Text Manipulation**: A deep dive into string functions for cleaning, parsing, and formatting (`TRIM`, `SUBSTRING`, `REPLACE`).
* **Character Encoding**: Understanding **`UTF-8`** for multilingual data and comparing `ASCII()`/`CHR()` in SQL with Python's `ord()`/`chr()` and `.encode()`/`.decode()`.
* **Cryptographic Hashing**: Securing data with the **`pgcrypto`** extension (`digest()`, `crypt()`) and understanding hash collisions.
* **Full-Text Search**: Optimizing text queries with specialized indexes like **`GIN`** and **`GiST`**.

### 4. Regular Expressions
**Notebooks:**
