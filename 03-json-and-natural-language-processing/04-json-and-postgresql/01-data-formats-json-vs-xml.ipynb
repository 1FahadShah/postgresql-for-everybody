    "When two different applications need to communicate (e.g., a web browser and a server, or two microservices), they need a common, text-based language to structure the data they send to each other. This is a **data interchange format**. It ensures that the receiving application can reliably parse and understand the data sent by the other, regardless of the programming language or operating system each one uses."

    "\n",

    "- **Verbose**: The use of opening and closing tags makes XML files larger than their JSON counterparts.\n",
    "- **Strictly Structured**: XML documents must be \"well-formed\" with a single root element and properly nested tags.\n",
