    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we learned how to perform the four fundamental CRUD operations. More importantly, we learned about the atomic nature of database transactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- By default, `psycopg2` starts a new transaction when you execute your first command.\n",
    "- Changes are only made permanent and visible to other connections when you call `connection.commit()`.\n",
    "- You can discard all changes made since the last commit by calling `connection.rollback()`.\n",
    "- Using a `with psycopg2.connect(...) as conn:` block will automatically `commit` on successful exit or `rollback` if an exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This transactional control is essential for writing reliable and robust database applications."
