# Course 3 - JSON and Natural Language Processing in PostgreSQL
[![Coursera Certificate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coursera-Certificate-blue?logo=coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/VD8ZWISGEXQX)

This repository contains hands-on Jupyter notebooks built and documented by **Fahad Shah (1FahadShah)**. It represents my personal learning journey and practical solutions for **[Course 3: JSON and Natural Language Processing in PostgreSQL](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/VD8ZWISGEXQX)** from the **PostgreSQL for Everybody Specialization** offered by the **University of Michigan** on Coursera.

This course covers a wide range of advanced topics, bridging the gap between the database and application. It starts with a deep dive into database internals and Full-Text Search, then moves to application development with Python, data interchange formats like JSON, and finally culminates in building a functional web API.

## ðŸ“š Course Structure

This course consists of **four main modules**, each documented with dedicated notebooks that build from foundational theory to practical, real-world application.

## ðŸ““ Notebook Overviews

### 1. Natural Language in PostgreSQL
**Highlights:**
* **Physical Storage is the Foundation:** Understanding how data is stored in **pages** with unique `ctid`s is the key to all database performance.
* **Indexes are Not Optional:** The difference between a `Seq Scan` and an `Index Scan` is the difference between an unusable and a high-performance application.
* **Inverted Indexes Power Search:** The concept of mapping terms to documents is the fundamental principle behind all text search.
* **PostgreSQL FTS is Production-Ready:** The built-in engine (`tsvector`, `tsquery`) provides a sophisticated solution that handles stemming, stop words, ranking, and complex queries.
* **Use the Right Index for the Job:** While **B-Tree** is the default for most data types, a **GIN** index is essential for making `tsvector`-based searches fast and efficient.

### 2. Inverted Indexes with PostgreSQL
**Highlights:**
* **GIN is a Versatile Tool:** GIN is a general-purpose inverted index designed for "composite" data types like `array`, `JSONB`, and `tsvector`.
* **FTS Configurations are Crucial:** The "language" (`'english'`, `'french'`) is a full configuration that dictates stop words and stemming, and choosing the right one is critical for accuracy.
* **Query Functions Match Use Cases:** PostgreSQL provides multiple functions (`to_tsquery`, `plainto_tsquery`, `phraseto_tsquery`) to parse search strings for different scenarios.
* **Automation is the Production Standard:** The most robust way to implement FTS is with a dedicated `tsvector` column automatically kept in sync using a **database trigger**.

### 3. Python and PostgreSQL
**Highlights:**
* **`psycopg2` is the Standard:** It's the essential library for connecting any Python application to a PostgreSQL database.
* **Transactions are Explicit:** Database changes are atomic and are not saved until you explicitly `commit()` them, ensuring data integrity.
* **Parameterization is Non-Negotiable Security:** Always use placeholders (`%s`) to pass data into queries to make SQL injection impossible.
* **Handle Data Intelligently:** Use `DictCursor` for readable code or load data directly into a **Pandas DataFrame** for powerful analysis.
* **Build for Production:** Use `executemany()` for bulk operations and understand the critical need for **connection pooling**.

### 4. Data Formats, Python, and PostgreSQL APIs
**Highlights:**
* **JSON is the Lingua Franca of APIs:** Its lightweight syntax and direct mapping to native data structures make it the ideal choice for modern web services.
* **Always Prefer `JSONB` in PostgreSQL:** For any serious application, the binary, indexable `JSONB` type is vastly superior to the plain text `JSON` type.
* **GIN Indexes are Essential for `JSONB` Performance:** To efficiently query `JSONB` data using operators like containment (`@>`), a **GIN index** is a requirement for scalability.
* **The Full Stack Connects:** A complete application involves a client consuming a **JSON API**, powered by a server (like **Flask**) that in turn queries a database (like **PostgreSQL**).
